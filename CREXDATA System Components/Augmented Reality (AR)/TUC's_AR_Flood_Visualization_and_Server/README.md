# AR Application for Emergency Response

## Overview

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to assist emergency responders during flood situations. The application is developed using Unity and the Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK3) for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 device. It provides real-time 3D visualizations of flood forecasts and critical points of interest (POIs) to enhance situational awareness and decision-making capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time 3D Visualizations:** Display flood forecasts and POIs such as schools, hospitals, and stations.
- **Dynamic Water Levels:** Visualize changing water levels based on real-time data.
- **Interactive POIs:** Interact with POIs to get detailed information.
- **Environmental Scanning:** Utilize HoloLens 2 capabilities to scan and create meshes of the environment for better occlusion and interaction.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface designed for emergency responders.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/giannisaf2/CrexData-Flood-Visualization-AR.git
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Ensure you have the MRTK and necessary packages installed.
4. Build and deploy to HoloLens 2.

## Usage

1. Start the application on HoloLens 2.
2. Have your palm facing the camera to enable the menu (Palm Pose menu)
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the device.
4. Use gaze and pinch gestures to interact with POIs.
5. Enable and disable water visualization using the provided toggle button.
6. Enable and disable the Map.
7. Access the help panel for guidance on using the app.
