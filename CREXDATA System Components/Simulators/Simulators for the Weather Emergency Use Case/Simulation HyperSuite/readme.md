# Simulator HyperSuite GUI

The Weather Emergencies Use Case Simulator HyperSuite (EmCase SHS) contains different simulators. The EmCase SHS-GUI is a web application that simplifies parameter input. Inserted parameters are sent to the defined endpoints and processed in Altair RapidMiner AI Studio workflows to configure the simulators accordingly and trigger the simulations. The web application is based on Vue.js. It has a modular design to easily add further simulators.
