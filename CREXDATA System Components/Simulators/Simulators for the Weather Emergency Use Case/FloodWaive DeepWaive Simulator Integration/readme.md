# Floodwaive

[Floodwaive](https://www.floodwaive.de/) uses deep learning technology to create flooding predicitions within seconds. This repository includes workflows used to configure and start flood simulations and retrieve simulation results. Moreover, it contains example outputs and adapted Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

## Datasets
This directory contains adapted DEMs and example outputs. Available DEMs from [OpenGeodata.NRW](https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/hm/dgm1_tiff/) were modified with elevation changes, which could be caused by landslides or private barriers in a flooding situation. In addition, the repository contains example simulation outputs in the form of GeoTiffs, which represent the water distribution in the simulated area.
