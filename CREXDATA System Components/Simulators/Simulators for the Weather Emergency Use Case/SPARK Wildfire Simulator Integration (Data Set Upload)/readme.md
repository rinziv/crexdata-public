## Datasets
This repository includes example outputs of the Spark wildfire simulation in json format for the pilot sites in Dortmund and Innsbruck. Every json file describes a polygon representing the fire line for a specific point in time. All files within one folder describe the timely development of the fire line at 5-minute intervals.
